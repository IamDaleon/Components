# Components

Upon brushing up on my skills to become a better developer, I have decided to work on some components to strenghten my core fondations of HTML, CSS and, Javascript. These components are completely modular thus, making easier to quickly be able to make a website.

### Some of this components are

  - [Search Box](/components/searchbox/searchish.html) 
  - [Navigation Menu]()
  - [Headers]()
  - [Contact]()
  - [Footers]()

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Computer
Browser (Google Chrome)
IDE (VSC, Atom or Sublime)
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

With your computer on and ready to code

```
Open the code editor of your choice
```

With the editor open

Using a multiple of the components code together, should make you a fully functional site/ web app.
